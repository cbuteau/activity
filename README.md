## Idea

A rethinking of using WebWorkers.

## Links

+ [WebWorkers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker)

## Background

Coding webworkers got me to understand threading in the web.
But it got no adoption.

As ES6 starts to become adopted in browsers I decided to rewrite concepts from scratch.

## Concepts

+ Start from scratch.
+ Think high level API first.
+ Think integration into many systems...requirejs, react, etc.


## Names

+ A task is run of a RAF mechanism.
+ A job is something that runs in a thread (WebWorkers)
+ A career is a long running job for the life of the application.
