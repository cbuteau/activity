## Idea
A rethinking of using WebWorkers.


## Background

Coding webworkers got me to understand threading in the web.
But it got no adoption.

## Concepts

+ Start from scratch.
+ Think high level API first.
+ Think integration into many systems...requirejs, react, etc.


## Names

+ A task is run of a RAF mechanism.
+ A job is something that runs in a thread (WebWorkers)
+ A career is a long running job for the life of the application.
